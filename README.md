# Employee Tracker
## [GitHub](https://github.com/dylandewey/employeetracker.git)
This application is a way too keep track of employees within a company.  Employees, roles, and departments can be added.  Each employee is assigned a manager, a role, and given a salary. Roles can then be changed.  All roles, employees, and departments can be viewed within the console in a table from mySQL.  I started working on other functions like removing employees, departments, and roles but I haven't gotten that far yet.
